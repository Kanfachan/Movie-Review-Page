## Description:

Greetings!

This **Moview Review Page** is an HTML workshop offered by freeCodeCamp. 

The goal of this project is to develop an HTML-based movie review page that presents content in a structured, accessible, and visually engaging format. The page will feature semantic HTML elements to enhance both usability and compatibility with screen readers and assistive technologies.

This project demonstrates the power of semantic HTML in creating inclusive and user-friendly content presentation. By applying well-structured markup and thoughtful accessibility features, the final page ensures that movie fans of all backgrounds can enjoy and engage with the review experience.
